## ðŸŒŒ About The Project

This project is an interstellar journey through the galaxy of Natural Language Processing, powered by GPT-X models. Users can train, customize, and interact with AI models in a thematic environment that combines the intrigue of space exploration with the cutting-edge capabilities of AI.

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Model Customization**: Customize your GPT-X model's parameters for optimal performance across various tasks.
- **Model Training**: Train your AI model using different datasets, represented as data crystals from across the galaxy.
- **Model Testing**: Engage with your AI model through the AI Communication Interface, querying it to uncover insights and generate text.
- **Dynamic Model Management**: Choose from various AI entities, each a different version of the GPT-X model saved within the ship's database.
